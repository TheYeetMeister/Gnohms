## This is our project website for CS 175 (W25) - Project in Artifical Intelligence. 

Our project focuses on utilizing and creating a working self-driving AI model using the enviornment of Unreal Engine to virtually simulate the enviornment. We seek to use Proximal Policy Optimziation (PPO) with reinforcement learning in order to train our model.
